// DEMO: one user with a bunch of data (Andres, Georgia)

TODO bugs:

1) if user is logged in, and you do npm start and ./run -gui (after not having run in a
while), fridge wont show; not sure how big a deal this is

2) I got this once, but after I deleted an ingredient and went to search for new ingredients, nothing showed up?
